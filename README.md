# Random Acts Of Kindness

RAOK ("Are-Ay-Oh-Kay") lets you ***request help*** with any task 
and ***find people near you that need help***.

## WHY 

- Anyone should be able to **get help with** ***anything***.
- We want to **use a spare minute to help someone in need**.

## PAIN

> Veronika was moving house and could have used some help
> carying her heavy wardrobe up a flight of stairs.
> this would have a been a 5 min task for a strong person.

People have mini-tasks or "acts" they need help with all the time.
If we all had a way of sharing 

## WHAT 

A website (mobile friendly) that anyone can use to post/find tasks and request/give help.
